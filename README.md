# QR-Code-Project
this app basically generate qr images by taking inputs as link from user in console
I used two npm packages to create this app 
1. inquirer npm package to get user input.
2. qr-image npm package to turn the user entered URL into a QR code image
3. used native File System module to save the user input.
